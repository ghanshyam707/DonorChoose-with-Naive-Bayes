# DonorChoose-with-Naive-Bayes

In this project I have applied `Naive Bayse` algorithm on the Donor Choose database. As the dataset have most important features like `Project Title` and `Project Discription` as text, `NB` should give better result than other algorithms.<br>

I have Created two dataset by vectorizing text features with different technnniques.<br>

**Set1** | Vectorizing text features with `Bag Of Words`<br>
**Set2** | Vectorizing text features with `TFIDF`<br>

`Set1` Gives better result than set2. That is `NB` works better with `BOG` than `TFIDf` for this dataset.<br>
`Test AUC` for set1 is `0.70`.
